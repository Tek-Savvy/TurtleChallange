# TurtleChallange

A turtle must walk through a minefield. Write a program that will read the initial game settings from one file and a sequence of moves #   from a different file.
Then the program will output if the sequence leads to the success or failure of the little turtle.
The program should also handle the scenario where the turtle doesn’t reach the exit point or doesn’t hit a mine.

# Inputs
The board is a grid of n by m number of tiles:(5x4 Board)
